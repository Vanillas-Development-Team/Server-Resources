# New Vanilla's World Mail Guide
Welcome to the complete list of Mod**Mail** Guide for Vanilla's Mareep. Mailing is the best way to get help from our Staff Team, Art Posters and Giveaways. We want to make the process easy as possible and make it seamless for you to send mails. Sending mails **do not** involve your email address, this process is done in discord without any real life information.

## Disclaimer
Before we start, we highly encourage you to turn on Allow direct messages from server members. We need this permission to be turned on to send you **D**irect **M**essages for updates, such as receiving mails from our Staff Team. If you have this permission turned on, you can also receive moderation-related updates such as warnings, mutes, bans or nickname changes made to you.

## Mail Guide
Mail is a feature built into our bot Vanilla's Mareep to help you contact our Staff Team and get assistance. How it works is, you send a mail to our Staff Team (directly within our command channels at [New Vanilla's World](https://discord.gg/cB6gXF5rxp) or [LOL](https://discord.gg/Ax385KPvth)) and our Staff will respond to you with a mail which will be sent in your DMs.

### Step 1: Use the Mail command and pick a category
When you type `.mail` in a command channel, you will be presented with a list of categories. In order to help you receive a quicker response we have a system to sort messages into categories. When you pick a category, your Mail will be delivered to appropriate Staff Members insetad of sending it to all Staff Members and waiting for someone who is responsible to see your mail within hundreds of mails we receive everyday and respond to you.

Please keep in mind that purposely picking the wrong category for your mails is **punishable** by our Staff Members.

Here is a list of the category names you can use
- `.mail submitart`: This is for submitting your artwork to be posted in our [art channel](https://discord.gg/xk8putxQc8).
- `.mail hostgiveaway`: This is for hosting giveaways in our [giveaways channel](https://discord.gg/fksb8qXy6v)
- `.mail reportuser`: This is for reporting users who have broken the Server Rules.
- `.mail reportstaff`: This is for submitting Staff Members who have broken the Server Rules. Please avoid reporting Staff Members is you think your punishment was unjustified, submit an appeal instead.
- `.mail suggestion`: This is for submitting suggestions for the server.
- `.mail other`: This is for uncategorized requests. Use this if your request isn't one of the categories listed above.

### Step 2: Type your mail
After you type `.mail (Category Name)` you need to enter your mail. Please replace `(Category Name)` with one of the category names from **Step 1**. When typing your mail, we need you to make sure that what you're explaining in your mail is clearly understandable without having to send further replies to understand you. Don't get us wrong, we will respond to your mail (obviously) but having a long thread with multiple mails just to understand what you're trying to say is not acceptable as you waste our Staff Members and your own time.

There are some specific things to include in your mail when submitting a request for each one of the available categories. Please replace the `(your message)` part with what you want to say.
- `.mail submitart`: We need you to read [#art-info](https://discord.gg/nrW9C97BV6) before submitting your artwork.
- `.mail hostgiveaway`: Please provide the prize (the prize should be digitally claimable. please provide the code to claim the prize), requirements to enter the giveaway and duration (how long the giveaway will last). you can additionally include a note from you.
- `.mail reportuser`: You should include the [User ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) for the user you're reporting, evidence of the user breaking the rules and some context on the situation (what is going on, which rules the user is breaking etc.).
- `.mail reportstaff`: You should include the [User ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) for the Staff Member you're reporting, evidence of the Staff Member breaking the rules and some context on the situation (what is going on, which rules the user is breaking etc.). You can also report Staff Members who are abusing their permissions.
- `.mail suggestion`: Please tell us about your suggestion.
- `.mail other`: Type your request.

### Additional Information
After you send your mail using the steps above you should wait for a response. Please keep in mind that Mails and Punishment information is not disclosed to any users except for our Staff Team. We expect you to help us keep this information private as well.

Please avoid
