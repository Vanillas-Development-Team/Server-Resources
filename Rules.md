We have rules in place to provide a safe and friendly environment to everyone.

## Additional Information
We have listed some Additional Information to here.

- All rules apply at all times and in all channels. There might be some channels that are an exception to this rule such as #epic-chat at New Vanilla's World. Swearing is allowed in this channel. Please read the channel description or pinned messages to learn more about that channel. Most of the time, all rules apply at all channels. Please use common sense and avoid finding "loopholes" or workarounds in the rules.
- You are not allowed to copy, modify or make anything similar to our server content including (but isn't limited to) our server icon, banners, profile pictures.
- Violation of these rules are punishable by our Staff Team who are working hard every day to moderate the server. Most of the time, your punishment will expire after a select amount of time. This information is available under "Expiration" in the **D**irect **M**essage you receive from our bot Vanilla's Mareep. Our bot is resposbile for handling moderation-related events in the server. You can also use `.search` at #commands / #potato-commands to view punishment information.
- You are not allowed to mention Owners, Admins or Head Moderators. This means to ping them using `@username`. This is not allowed because our Moderators and Trainee Moderators can solve most of the issues around the server and you are highly encouraged to use `.mail` to send a mail to our Staff Team. Asking your question in chat is not helpful and it will only cause clutter in chat.
- Influencing users who have proken the rules is not allowed. This includes baiting people into admitting they are underage, making people spam ping you or spam the chat.
- Content in the server can be recorded by our Staff Team for moderation purposes and applications (bots). We make an effort to prevent this by only using 3rd party applications that meet our security requirements and giving them limited access to the server and using our own, in-house applications developed by Vanilla's Development Team. The complete list of applications developed by Vanilla's Development Team can be found at [#staff-list at New Vanilla's World](https://discord.gg/cB6gXF5rxp). You give us permission to record content in the server.
- Follow the [Discord Terms Of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) alongside the server rules.
- When using 3rd party applications at our command channels, the Privacy Policy and Guidelines apply for that application. We are not responsible for the actions taken by 3rd party developers (such as getting banned from using an application).
